• It's a very common condition amongst children

Symptoms to look for:

   o Picking nose with sharp nails
   o High humidity
   o Extreme temperatures

Natural home remedy using ice:

1. Take a clean piece of cloth
2. Wrap a few ice cubes in it
3. Sit in an upright position
4. Tilt your head forward
5. Hold the ice pack on the nose for 5-6 min

Natural home remedy:

1. Pinch the part of your nose below the bony bridge
2. Press gently for 5 min
3. Release the pressure
4. It's normal if you feel a tingling sensation, it's just the blood rushing back

Tips:

• Don't clean your nose after the bleeding stops as this will remove the clots and cause bleeding again
• Do not lie down or throw head backwards during nose bleed as this will make the blood flow to your
   throat and make you choke
