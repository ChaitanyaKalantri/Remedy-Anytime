Snoring:

• Snoring is a common sleep related problem
• It is troublesome for the sufferer as well as the people around them

Causes:

• During sleep, muscles in the mouth relax
• At times, the tongue falls back
• This obstructs the passage of air which leads to snoring
• External factors which cause snoring are:
   o Physical exertion
   o Consuming alcohol
   o Certain medicines
