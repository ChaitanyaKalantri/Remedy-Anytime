Living a healthier life can not only extend your life, it can also improve the quality. Feeling physically better and having control over your own life can greatly increase 
your mental health as well. Although there are some aspects of physical and mental health that are beyond an individual's (and science's) control, there are many things 
that people can do to improve their quality of life.

The purpose of this part is to introduce you to some of the basic practices and guidelines of healthy living. Because every person (and his or her physical health and 
abilities) is unique, not all of the information in this course may apply. 
It is important to check with your doctor or medical care provider when changing your lifestyle. However, the information from this part may provide you with 
some basic guidelines for developing your own healthy living plan.
