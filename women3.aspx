<div class="healthy1">5. CALVES: Single-Leg Donkey Calf Raise</div>
<div class="healthy1">The benefit:</div>This simple exercise helps shape your calves in the comfort of your living room. <br />
<div class="healthy1">How to do it:</div>Place the ball of one foot on a step, block, or 25-pound weight plate.
 Cross your other foot behind your ankle. Grasp a sturdy object for support. Then keeping your back naturally arched, 
 bend at your hips and lower your torso until your upper body is almost parallel to the floor [A]. 
 Lift your heel as high as you can [B]. Pause, lower your heel, and repeat. Complete as many reps as you can—or for 
 a duration of 60 seconds—then switch legs.<br />

  <div class="healthy1">6. CHEST: Single-Arm Dumbbell Bench Press</div>
<div class="healthy1">The benefit:</div> This exercise works your glutes and abs as hard as it works your chest and triceps. 
So you'll tighten your hips and core as you tone your upper body. <br />
<div class="healthy1">How to do it:</div>Grab a dumbbell in your left hand and lie on your back on a flat bench, 
holding the dumbbell over your chest with your arm straight. Your palm should be facing out, but turned slightly inward. 
Place your right hand on your abs [B]. Lower the dumbbell to the side of your chest. Pause, 
then press the weight back to the start. Want an even greater challenge? Slide over so that only your right butt cheek
 and right shoulder blade are on the bench. (Don't let your hips sag; you'll have to place your left foot wider to maintain your balance.)
  Do all your repetitions, then repeat on your right side.<br />
