        <div class="healthy">Introduction</div>
          There's a popular saying among fitness experts: "The best exercise is the one you're not doing." 
          The take-home message? To achieve the best results, you need to regularly challenge your body in new ways.
           So while classic movements like the pushup, lunge, and squat are the staples of any good workout plan, 
           varying the way you perform these exercises every 4 weeks can help you avoid plateaus, beat boredom, and speed fat loss.<br />
<div class="healthy1">1. ABS: Mountain Climber with Hands on Swiss Ball</div>
<div class="healthy1">The benefit:</div> one of the simplest yet most effective ways to tighten your tummy. 
In fact, you'll barely have to move a muscle. <br />
<div class="healthy1">How to do it:</div> Assume a pushup position with your arms completely straight, 
but place your hands on a Swiss ball instead of the floor. Your body should form a straight line from your
 head to your ankles. Tighten your core and hold it that way for the duration of the exercise [A].
  Lift one foot off the floor and slowly raise your knee as close to your chest as you can without changing your lower-back posture.
  Then repeat with your other leg. Alternate back and forth for 30 seconds. If that's too hard, place your hands 
  on the floor or a bench, instead of a Swiss ball. <br />

  <div class="healthy1">2. GLUTES: Hip Raise</div>
<div class="healthy1">The benefit:</div> It targets the muscles of your rear end, which can help make your belly flatter.
 The reason: When your glutes are weak—as they are in most women—the top of your pelvis tilts forward.
  This not only places stress on your lower back, but it causes your tummy to stick out—even if you don't
   have an ounce of fat. Your fix: the hip raise. <br />
<div class="healthy1">How to do it:</div> Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and your feet 
flat on the floor [A]. Now brace your core, squeeze your glutes, and raise your hips so your body forms a 
straight line from your shoulders to your knees [B]. Pause for 3 to 5 seconds—squeezing your glutes tightly
 the entire time—then lower back to the start. <br />
