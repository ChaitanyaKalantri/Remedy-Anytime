<div class="healthy1">9. BICEPS: Split Stance Dumbbell Curl</div>
<div class="healthy1">The benefit:</div>Placing one foot in front of you on a bench forces your hip and core muscles 
to work harder in order to keep your body stable. That way, you engage more muscles and burn more calories than
 you would if you did the exercise in a regular standing position. <br />
<div class="healthy1">How to do it:</div>Grab a pair of dumbbells and place one foot in front of you on a bench
 or step that's just higher than knee level. Let the dumbbells hang at arm's length next to your sides,
  your palms facing forward [B]. Without moving your upper arms, bend your elbows and curl the dumbbells as
   close to your shoulders as you can [B]. Pause, then slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.
    Each set, switch the foot that you place on the bench.<br />

  <div class="healthy1">10. FOREARMS: Plate Pinch Curl</div>
<div class="healthy1">The benefit:</div> Strengthens the muscles of your forearms, hands, fingers, and thumbs,
 while also shaping your biceps. Bonus: Makes you better at opening jars, too. <br />
<div class="healthy1">How to do it:</div>Grab a pair of light weight plates in your right hand. 
Hold the two plates together with your fingers and thumb by pinching the smooth side of the plates.
 Let the plates hang at arm's length next to your side [A]. Without moving your upper arm, bend your
  elbow and curl the weights as close to your shoulder as you can [B]. Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position and repeat.<br />
