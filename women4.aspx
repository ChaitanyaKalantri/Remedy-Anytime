<div class="healthy1">7. SHOULDERS: Scaption and Shrug</div>
<div class="healthy1">The benefit:</div>When you raise the dumbbells to start this exercise, 
you target the front of your shoulders as well as your rotator cuff. Then comes the shrug.
 This part of the move helps better balance the muscles that rotate your shoulder blades. 
 The end result: Great-looking shoulders and better posture. <br />
<div class="healthy1">How to do it:</div>Stand holding a pair of dumbbells with your feet shoulder-width apart.
 Let the dumbbells hang at arm's length next to your sides, your palms facing each other [A].
  Without changing the bend in your elbows, raise your arms until they're parallel to the floor,
   keeping them at a 30-degree angle to your body (so that they form a "Y") [B].
    At the top of the movement, shrug your shoulders upward [C]. Pause, then reverse the movement to return to the start, and repeat.<br />

  <div class="healthy1">8. TRICEPS: Swiss-Ball Lying Triceps Extension</div>
<div class="healthy1">The benefit:</div> Lying on a Swiss ball forces your core to work harder to keep you stable.
 So you work your abs as you shape the backs of your arms. <br />
<div class="healthy1">How to do it:</div>Grab a pair of dumbbells and lie on your back on a Swiss ball 
so that your middle and upper back are firmly on the ball. Raise your hips so that your body forms a straight line 
from your knees to your shoulders. Hold the dumbbells over your forehead, with your arms straight 
and your palms facing each other [A]. Without moving your upper arms, bend your elbows to lower the dumbbells 
until your forearms are beyond parallel to the floor [B]. Pause, then lift the weights back to the start by straightening your arms.<br />
