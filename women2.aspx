<div class="healthy1">3. QUADRICEPS: Offset Dumbbell Lunge</div>
<div class="healthy1">The benefit:</div>Holding a weight on just one side of your body increases the demand 
placed on your core to keep your body stable. The result: Your hips and abs have to work harder, and you'll
 also improve your balance. And better yet, you'll burn tons of calories. <br />
<div class="healthy1">How to do it:</div>Hold a dumbbell in your right hand next to your shoulder, with your arm bent [A].
 Step forward with your right leg and lower your body until your right knee is bent at least 90 degrees and your left
  knee nearly touches the floor [B]. Push yourself back to the starting position. That's 1 rep. Do all your reps,
   then repeat with your left leg, while holding the weight in your left hand. <br />

  <div class="healthy1">4. HAMSTRINGS: Single-Leg Dumbbell Straight-Leg Deadlift</div>
<div class="healthy1">The benefit:</div> Besides targeting your hamstrings, this exercise works your glutes and core. 
It also helps eliminate muscle imbalances between your legs, reducing your risk of injury. And as a bonus,
 it can even improve the flexibility of your hamstrings. <br />
<div class="healthy1">How to do it:</div> Grab a pair of dumbbells with an overhand grip,
 and hold them at arm's length in front your thighs. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart
  and knees slightly bent. Now raise one leg off the floor [A]. Without changing the bend in your knee,
   bend at your hips (keep your lower back arched), and lower your torso until it's almost parallel to the floor [B]. 
   Pause, then squeeze your glutes, thrust your hips forward, and raise your torso back to the start. Do all your reps,
    then repeat with your other leg.<br />
